## Getting Started

### Steps to Implement Redux
1. **Install Redux & React-Redux**
   ```sh
   npm install redux react-redux
   ```

2. **Create the Redux Store**
   - Set up a `store.js` file.
   - Set up slices
  

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - npm install  

4. **Connect Redux to the Application**
   - Wrap the application in the `<Provider>` component from `react-redux`.
   - Use Redux hooks (`useSelector` and `useDispatch`) to manage state in components.
